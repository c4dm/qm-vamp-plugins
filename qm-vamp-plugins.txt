Note Onset Detector
===================

*System identifier* --    [qm-onsetdetector]
*RDF URI* -- http://vamp-plugins.org/rdf/plugins/qm-vamp-plugins#qm-onsetdetector

Note Onset Detector analyses a single channel of audio and estimates
the onset times of notes within the music -- that is, the times at
which notes and other audible events begin.

It calculates an onset likelihood function for each spectral frame,
and picks peaks in a smoothed version of this function.  The plugin is
non-causal, returning all results at the end of processing.

Parameters
----------

*Onset Detection Function Type* -- The method used to calculate the
onset likelihood function.  The most versatile method is the default,
"Complex Domain" (see reference, Duxbury et al 2003).  "Spectral
Difference" may be appropriate for percussive recordings, "Phase
Deviation" for non-percussive music, and "Broadband Energy Rise" (see
reference, Barry et al 2005) for identifying percussive onsets in
mixed music.

*Onset Detector Sensitivity* -- Sensitivity level for peak detection
in the onset likelihood function.  The higher the sensitivity, the
more onsets will (rightly or wrongly) be detected.  The peak picker
does not have a simple threshold level; instead, this parameter
controls the required "steepness" of the slopes in the smoothed
detection function either side of a peak value, in order for that peak
to be accepted as an onset.

*Adaptive Whitening* -- This option evens out the temporal and
frequency variation in the signal, which can yield improved
performance in onset detection, for example in audio with big
variations in dynamics.

Outputs
-------

*Note Onsets* -- The detected note onset times, returned as a single
feature with timestamp but no value for each detected note.

*Onset Detection Function* -- The raw note onset likelihood function
that was calculated as the first step of the detection process.

*Smoothed Detection Function* -- The note onset likelihood function
following median filtering.  This is the function from which
sufficiently steep peak values are picked and classified as onsets.

Key Detector
============

*System identifier* --    [qm-keydetector]
 Authors:       Katy Noland and Christian Landone
 Category:      Key and Tonality

 References:    K. Noland and M. Sandler.
                Signal Processing Parameters for Tonality Estimation.
                In Proceedings of Audio Engineering Society 122nd
                Convention, Vienna, 2007.

The Key Detector plugin analyses a single channel of audio and
continuously estimates the key of the music.

It has four outputs: the tonic pitch of the key; a major or minor mode
flag; the key (combining the tonic and major/minor into a single
value); and a key strength plot which reports the degree to which the
chroma vector extracted from each input block correlates to the stored
key profiles for each major and minor key.  The key profiles are drawn
from analysis of Book I of the Well Tempered Klavier by J S Bach,
recorded at A=440 equal temperament.

The outputs have the values:

  Tonic pitch: C = 1, C#/Db = 2, ..., B = 12

  Major/minor mode: major = 0, minor = 1

  Key: C major = 1, C#/Db major = 2, ..., B major = 12
       C minor = 13, C#/Db minor = 14, ..., B minor = 24

  Key Strength Plot: 25 separate bins per feature, separated into 1-12
       (major from C) and 14-25 (minor from C).  Bin 13 is unused, not
       for superstitious reasons but simply so as to delimit the major
       and minor areas if they are displayed on a single plot by the
       plugin host.  Higher bin values show increased correlation with
       the key profile for that key.

The outputs are also labelled with pitch or key as text.


Tonal Change

The Tonal Change plugin analyses a single channel of audio, detecting
harmonic changes such as chord boundaries.

It has three outputs: a representation of the musical content in a
six-dimensional tonal space onto which the algorithm maps 12-bin
chroma vectors extracted from the audio; a function representing the
estimated likelihood of a tonal change occurring in each spectral
frame; and the resulting estimated positions of tonal changes.


Segmenter
---------

*System identifier* --    [qm-segmenter]
 Authors:       Mark Levy
 Category:      Classification

 References:    M. Levy and M. Sandler.
                Structural segmentation of musical audio by constrained
                clustering.
                IEEE Transactions on Audio, Speech, and Language Processing,
                February 2008.

The Segmenter plugin divides a single channel of music up into
structurally consistent segments.  Its single output contains a
numeric value (the segment type) for each moment at which a new
segment starts.

For music with clearly tonally distinguishable sections such as verse,
chorus, etc., the segments with the same type may be expected to be
similar to one another in some structural sense (e.g. repetitions of
the chorus).

The type of feature used in segmentation can be selected using the
Feature Type parameter.  The default Hybrid (Constant-Q) is generally
effective for modern studio recordings, while the Chromatic option may
be preferable for live, acoustic, or older recordings, in which
repeated sections may be less consistent in sound.  Also available is
a timbral (MFCC) feature, which is more likely to result in
classification by instrumentation rather than musical content.

Note that this plugin does a substantial amount of processing after
receiving all of the input audio data, before it produces any results.



* Segmenter

parameters:
               Number of segment-types

** set this to a rough guess at the maximum number of different types of section (chorus, bridge, solo, verse, intro, outro, etc.) in the track – better to set it to too high a value than too low


               Feature Type

** the readme is ok on this


               Minimum segment duration

** set this to the duration of the shortest section that you would expect to see in the structure – changing this parameter may help the plugin find musical sections rather than just following changes in the sound of the music

outputs:
               Segmentation

** a list of numbered sections intended to correspond to the musical structure of the track (intro:verse:chorus:etc.) – sections labelled with the same number should contain similar-sounding music


Algorithm and plugin settings in brief:

The applied segmentation approach introduces the concept of timbre-type extraction and the use of structural/timbral similarity to obtain the high-level song structure. This is based on the assumption that the distribution of timbre features are similar over corresponding structural elements of the music. Thus, a fairly consistent timbre distribution is assumed over each structural segment.

The algorithm works by obtainig a frequency-domain representation  of the audio signal using a Constant-Q transform, a Chromagram or Mel-Frequency Cepstral Coefficients (MFCC) as underlying features. The user is provided with the option of selecting one of these features using the - Feature Type - plugin parameter. The optimal window size and the hop size for the feature extraction are: 200ms hop size and 600ms window size. These values correspond to the default processing parameters of - 13230 audio frames per block (window size) - and a window increment of 4410, given a sample rate of 22.5 kHz. The user is expected to adjust these parameters for the actual audio sample rate. The extracted features are normalised in accordance with the MPEG-7 standard and a corresponding energy envelope is stored for each block of audio. This is followed by the extraction of 20 principal components per block using PCA. This yields a sequence of 21 dimensional feature vectors where the last element in each vector corresponds to the envelope. To obtain timbre features, an 40 state Hidden Markov Model is trained on the whole sequence of features. Each state of the HMM corresponds to a specific timbre-type. This process partitions the timbre-space of a given track into 40 possible types. The important assumption of the model is that the distribution of these features remain consistent over a structural segment. After training and decoding the HMM, the song is assigned a sequence of timbre-features according to specific timbre-type distributions for each possible structural segment. The segmentation itself is computed by clustering timbre-type histograms. A series of histograms are created over a sliding window which are grouped into M clusters by an adapted soft k-means algorithm. Each of these clusters will correspond to a specific segment-type of the analyzed song. Reference histograms, iteratively updated during clustering, describe the timbre distribution for each segment. The segmentation arises from the final cluster assignments. The number of clusters (segment-types) is typically set to 10. Unlike many clustering algorithms, the constrained clustering used in this plugin does not produce too many clusters or vary significantly even if this is set too high. However, this parameter can be useful for limiting the number of expected segment-types. Lastly, to avoid wasting a segment-type cluster for timbrally distinct but too short segments, the minimum segment duration parameter can be optianally set between 1-15s. A typical value of 4s usually produces good results.

::      Number of segment types: 2-12 (10)
::      Feature-Type: CQ, Chroma, MFCC (CQ)

Similarity

                In Proceedings of the Seventh International Conference on
                Music Information Retrieval (ISMIR), 2006.

The Similarity plugin treats each channel of its audio input as a
separate "track", and estimates how similar the tracks are to one
another using a selectable similarity measure.

The plugin also returns the intermediate data used as a basis of the
similarity measure; it can therefore be used on a single channel of
input (with the resulting intermediate data then being applied in some
other similarity or clustering algorithm, for example) if desired, as
well as with multiple inputs.

The underlying audio features used for the similarity measure can be
selected using the Feature Type parameter.  The available features are
Timbre (in which the distance between tracks is a symmetrised
Kullback-Leibler divergence between Gaussian-modelled MFCC means and
variances across each track); Chroma (KL divergence of mean chroma
histogram); Rhythm (cosine distance between "beat spectrum" measures
derived from a short sampled section of the track); and combined
"Timbre and Rhythm" and "Chroma and Rhythm".

The plugin has six outputs: a matrix of the distances between input
channels; a vector containing the distances between the first input
channel and each of the input channels; a pair of vectors containing
the indices of the input channels in the order of their similarity to
the first input channel, and the distances between the first input
channel and each of those channels; the means of the underlying
feature bins (MFCCs or chroma); the variances of the underlying
feature bins; and the beat spectra used for the rhythmic feature.

Because Vamp does not have the capability to return features in matrix
form explicitly, the matrix output is returned as a series of vector
features timestamped at one-second intervals.  Likewise, the
underlying feature outputs contain one vector feature per input
channel, timestamped at one-second intervals (so the feature for the
first channel is at time 0, and so on).  Examining the features that
the plugin actually returns, when run on some test data, may make this
arrangement more clear.

Note that the underlying feature values are only returned if the
relevant feature type is selected.  That is, the means and variances
outputs are valid provided the pure rhythm feature is not selected;
the beat spectra output is valid provided rhythm is included in the
selected feature type.


Constant-Q Spectrogram
----------------------

*System identifier* --    [qm-constantq]

 References:    J. Brown.
                Calculation of a constant Q spectral transform.

                425-434, 1991.

The Constant-Q Spectrogram plugin calculates a spectrogram based on a
short-time windowed constant Q spectral transform.  This is a
spectrogram in which the ratio of centre frequency to resolution is
constant for each frequency bin.  The frequency bins correspond to the
frequencies of "musical notes" rather than being linearly spaced in
frequency as they are for the conventional DFT spectrogram.

The pitch range and the number of frequency bins per octave may be
adjusted using the plugin's parameters.  Note that the plugin's
preferred step and block sizes depend on these parameters, and the
plugin will not accept any other block size.


Chromagram
----------

*System identifier* --    [qm-chromagram]
 Authors:       Christian Landone
 Category:      Visualisation

The Chromagram plugin calculates a constant Q spectral transform (as
above) and then wraps the frequency bin values into a single octave,
with each bin containing the sum of the magnitudes from the
corresponding bin in all octaves.  The number of values in each
feature vector returned by the plugin is therefore the same as the
number of bins per octave configured for the underlying constant Q
transform.

The pitch range and the number of frequency bins per octave for the
transform may be adjusted using the plugin's parameters.  Note that
the plugin's preferred step and block sizes depend on these
parameters, and the plugin will not accept any other block size.


Mel-Frequency Cepstral Coefficients
-----------------------------------

*System identifier* --    [qm-mfcc]

                Information Retrieval (ISMIR), 2000.

The Mel-Frequency Cepstral Coefficients plugin calculates MFCCs from a
single channel of audio, returning one MFCC vector from each process
call.  It also returns the overall means of the coefficient values
across the length of the audio input, as a separate output at the end
of processing.



MFCCs are used very widely, originally designed for speech recognition but now used for music classification and other tasks. Often 13 coefficients are used, with or without the "zero'th" coefficient (which simply reflects the overall signal power across the Mel frequency bands).
